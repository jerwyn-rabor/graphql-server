# GraphQL Server Readme

This repository contains a GraphQL server built using Express and TypeScript. It utilizes the `express-graphql` package for handling GraphQL queries and mutations. Follow the steps below to clone, install dependencies, and start the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (including npm)

## Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone "repository_url"
```

Replace `"repository_url"` with the actual URL of the repository.

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd graphql-server
npm install
```

This will install the following packages:

- `express`: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- `express-graphql`: Middleware that allows you to serve a GraphQL API over an Express server.
- `graphql`: The GraphQL query language library.
- `@types/express`: TypeScript type definitions for Express.
- `@types/graphql`: TypeScript type definitions for GraphQL.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler.

## Start the Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the GraphQL server using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will compile the TypeScript code and start the Express server with the GraphQL middleware. The server should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Using the GraphQL Server

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground by visiting `http://localhost:3000/graphql` in your web browser. The Playground provides an interactive environment where you can send queries and mutations to the server and explore its capabilities.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a basic layout:

```
graphql-server/
|-- src/
|   |-- schema.ts           # GraphQL schema definition
|   |-- server.ts           # Express server setup
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
|-- README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
```

- `schema.ts`: This file defines the GraphQL schema using the `graphql` package.
- `server.ts`: This file sets up the Express server, integrates the `express-graphql` middleware, and starts the server.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.

Feel free to modify and expand the project to fit your needs.
